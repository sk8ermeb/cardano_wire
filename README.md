# cardano_wire
Wordpress plugin for pulling articles off the cardano blockchain and publishing to your site. This can either be accomplished using blockfrost.io and their API. You will need an account with them, but the free tier should suffice for the purposes of this plugin. You can also run an actual cardano node, and the cardano db sync program so the app can extract the articles natively. In either case you will need to run an ipfs node on your system
